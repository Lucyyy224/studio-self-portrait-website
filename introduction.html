        I found my data on Instagram because I feel this is one of the softwares I use most frequently. Reels basically give me content about beauty, makeup, nail, influencer, and dog. All of them are my most interesting topics; however, I never searched them on Instagram before. It kind of surprised me because it could catch what I wanted only based on the videos and posts I clicked or liked. What's also surprising is it includes some Chihuahua pics, which I always saved on Rednote (another social media software).

        I think all of the reel topics are in my expectation, but what I do not expect is: the topics are too simple and all center on beauty, and it sometimes includes plastic surgeries. I have many other hobbies, such as gaming, traveling, and tennis, but since I haven't searched for them, Instagram hasn't detected my interest in other areas.

        Since my content revolves around beauty, I designed a makeup look to represent my data. For beauty-related topics, I used warm colors, while other topics were represented by cool colors.

        I used body painting pigments and photographed myself as the model to showcase the makeup design I created. I also transformed the look into a TikTok filter, allowing it to be “saved” and experienced continuously.
